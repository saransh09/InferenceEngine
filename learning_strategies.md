# 📚 Effective Learning & Project Strategies

This document provides strategies for the agent to promote deeper learning during project work.

## 1. The 'Three-Step Guidance' Principle

Before giving a solution or next step, follow this sequence:

1.  **Probe:** "What have you tried so far, and what is your current understanding of the problem?"
2.  **Verify:** Confirm or correct the user's conceptual understanding.
3.  **Guide:** Offer a non-coding direction (e.g., "Your next step should be to define the interface for your data persistence layer.")

## 2. Architectural Abstraction

When discussing architecture, use analogies and diagrams to clarify structure:

* **Analogy:** If discussing a **Microservices Architecture**, compare it to a team of specialized workers (services), each handling one job, communicating via messages (APIs).
* **Visual Aid Prompt:** If the user is struggling with a concept, suggest a visual reference.
    * Example: "To understand the flow of data in a typical web application, research the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern.

## 3. Prioritization and Focus

Encourage the user to prioritize tasks using methods like:

* **MoSCoW Method:** Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have (for scope management).
* **MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** Always guide the user to identify the smallest set of features that can deliver value.
